# Notes on using CC portable telescopes.

There are many possible combinations of equipment that can be used
together; eg, tripod, mount, OTA, camera,...


The approach used here will be to document each item in separate
pages.  For a given combination of equipoment, a \"manual\" can be
constructed by combining the relevant pages.

A few standard combinations are presented here.

## Mounts with Field Tripods

* [Skywatcher EQ6-R Pro](docs/mount/eq6.md)
* [Losmandy G11](docs/mount/losmandy.md)
* [Celestron](docs/mount/celestron.md)

## Optical Tube Assemblies (OTAs)

* [Celestron 8\"](docs/ota/celestron8.md)
* [Meade 8\"](docs/ota/meade8.md)
* [Meade 10\"](docs/ota/meade10.md)
* [Lunt Solar telescope](docs/ota/lunt.md)
