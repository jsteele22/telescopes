# Pier Adapter for Celestron EQ5 Mount.

The EQ5 mount is *much* sturdier on a pier than on it's tripod!

## Required

The following items are stored in the glass case by the Observatory
double doors:

* EQ5 **Pier Adapter**: a cylinder of unfinished aluminum, with a
  protruding tab on top.

* EQ5 **Pier Adapter Rod**: A chromed metal rod with threads on one
  end and an aluminum knob on the other.


## Setup

* Place the adapter above the large hole towards the northern end of
  the pier shelf.

* Orient the adapter so that the **azimuth adjustment post** on top is
  to the North.

* Try inserting the theaded end of the adapter rod through the large
  hole on the underside of the pier shelf. With the rod perfectly
  vertical, it should pass upwards through the very center of the pier
  adapter.

* Look at the base of the EQ5 mount and locate the the pair of screws
  with black plastic knobs. These are the **azimuth adjustment
  screws.**

* Look at the underside of the EQ5 mount an loosen both screws until
  there is plenty of space between them: an inch or 2-3 cm is good.

* Gently place the EQ5 mount on the pier adapter, being sure that the
  tips of the azimuth adjustment screws pass on either side of the
  azimuth adjustment post.

* As before, pass the threaded pier adapter rod from below the pier
  shelf up through the adapter and get it threaded into the mount.

* Screw in the rod until it is close but not all the way in.

* Slowly start to tighten the rod, being sure to wiggle the
  adapter/mount slighly. It is important that the adapter centers
  itself and all parts are vertically aligned.

* Tighten the rod until it is **snug, but not tight**.

Everything else follows the normal setup and alignment procedures for
the mount.


## Takedown

Be sure to return the Pier Adapter and the threaded Pier Adapter Rod to their
correct storage spot: the glass case by the double doors of the
observatory.
