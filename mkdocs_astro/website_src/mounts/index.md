The following mounts are available.  Each includes a tripod for field
use.

* [Skywatcher EQ6-R Pro](eq6/index.md) The newest mount, and best
  choice for general purpose use.  This mount has a USB port and can
  be controlled by a Windows computer or the hand controller.

* [Losmandy G11](losmandy/index.md) The strongest mount, very well
  made.  This mount has been motorized and has an open-source (OnStep)
  controller.

* [Celestron AS-GT](eq5/index.md) (aka EQ5) An older, lighter-weight
  mount. The original Celestron motors and controller are gone.  It
  now has stepper motors and an open-source (OnStep) controller.
