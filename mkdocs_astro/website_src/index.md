# CC Astronomy Documentation

A braindump of things to know about Colorado College astronomical
equipment and facilities.

This information resides in a [git
repository](https://github.com/jsteele22/telescopes). Additions and
changes *must* be made to the git repo or they will be lost.

Some of the repository content is converted into a simple HTML website
using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).  But for complete access, use *git*.
