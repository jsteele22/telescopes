# Using the Lunt Solar Telescope.

The OTA should already mounted and balanced.

For casual solar observing, precise alignment is not neccesary, but
the sun will drift out of view more quickly. When using the scope for
a group, it is best to put more effort into aligning the scope precisely..


## Easy Alignment

* Align the mount __azimuth__ using a best guess of true north; e.g., parallel
  to walls of Barnes hall. 
* Align the mount __altitude__ using your known lattitude and the scale on
  the mount; e.g., adjust dial to 38.8 degrees for Colorado Springs.
* Power on the mount and enable solar tracking.
* Point the scope towards the sun either using the hand controller or by
  using the clutches and moving the scope manually.
* When you get close, watch the rear black disk of the solar finder.  You are
  looking for a bright spot, the "shadow" of the hole in the front black disk.
* Using finer adjustments, move the scope until this spot is perfectly
  centered in the white circle of the rear finder disk.
* Look into the 25mm eyepiece and look for the sun.  You may need to move
  your head around to look off to the sides.
* Repeat as neccesary.

## Better Alignment

For better alignment, use telescope control software (such as
Stellarium) or the hand controller. For solar observing, there are
only two alignment targets that you can use: the scope's __home
position__ (always used by default) and the sun.


* Precisely align the mount __azimuth__ using a compass (smartphone
  app).
* Precisely align the mount __altitude__ using an inclinometer
  (smartphone app.)
* Be sure the scope is very precisely in __home position__ when
  powering the mount on.
* Be sure to use correct data for site location, time, etc.  
* When you have the sun centered, use that point to update the alignment.
* Each time you re-center the scope on the Sun, use that point to
  update the alignment.
* The tracking will improve more if the alignment points are widely
  separated.  So set up the scope and start the alignment well in
  advance.
* Note that some mounts have a __park__ feature.  When told to park,
  the scope slews to its home position and stores its alignment data
  over a power cycle.  Thus, a preliminary alignment can be done well
  in advance, and the scope parked and powered off.  When powered on
  again, one update on the sun's current position should provide a
  robust alignment.
 

## Pressure tuning the H-alpha line.

The bandpass filter in the H-alpha scope has a width of about 0.07
nm. This is much narrower than the range of wavelengths from
Doppler-shifted H-alpha light.

The central wavelength of the filter can be tuned using the large
brass knob on the side of the scope.  Thus, you can select a subset of
the H-alpha light, depending on its velocity toward/away from the Earth.

WARNING: If you unscrew the knob too far, it will come off.  Always
__hold onto it securely__ when loosening.

Here is a simple method for tuning:

* Loosen the knob about 2 or 3 turns from where it was when you found
  it. Here we are assuming the previous user left the scope tuned to
  an interesting wavelength.
* Obtain a sharp visual focus of the part of the sun you are
  interested in; e.g., a prominence on the sun's limb, or a central
  part of the solar disc.
* Gradually tighten the knob, watching for a change in contrast in the
  region of interest.  It shouldn't take too many turns to see a change.

NOTE: When taking images with a camera, the sun's rotation will be
visible as a brightening/darkening of opposite edges of the sun.
