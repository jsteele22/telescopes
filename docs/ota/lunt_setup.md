# Lunt Solar Scope Setup

The OTA should already be mounted.

* The __draw tube__ (the moving part of the OTA) must be extended in order
  to achieve focus.
  - Locate the black knurled __draw tube ring__ near the diagonal.
  - Slightly loosen the two knurled silver __draw tube screws__ in the
    draw tube ring. This allows the diagonal to move freely.
  - Extend the diagonal an inch or two away from the scope.
  - Note the coloring of the diagonal input tube.  Near the diagonal it is
    \"gold\" (???).  Farther away, it is black.
  - Align the gold/black boundary with the end of the draw tube ring.
    IOW, hide all of the black but none of the gold.
  - Tighten the two draw tube screws.
  - Hint: this is how you adjust the orientation of the eyepiece while
    observing.

* Insert the 25mm eyepiece.
* Unscrew the metal lens cover and store it in the aluminum case.

* If you are using any other accessories (i.e., a camera) mount them now.
* The scope must now be balanced.  This is discussed in the section on mounts.


The solar scope is now ready for alignment and use.
