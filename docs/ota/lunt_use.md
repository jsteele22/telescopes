# Using the Lunt Solar Telescope.

The OTA should already mounted and balanced.

Precise alignment is not needed for casual solar observing, but good
alignment means less re-centering.  Good alignment is recommended when
using a camera or when manmy people will be lining up to observe.

## Easy Alignment

* When setting up the mount, use landmarks (e.g. walls of Barnes Science
  Center) or possibly a compass to align the scope to true north.
* Be sure the azimuth setting of the mount is equal to your observing
  lattitude. (e.g., 38.8 degrees for Colorado Springs.)
* Power on your mount and enable tracking.  Use __solar tracking__ if available.
* Point the scope towards the sun either using the hand controller or by
  using the clutches and moving the scope manually.
* When you get close, watch the rear black disk of the solar finer.  You are
  looking for a bright spot, the "shadow" of the hole in the front black disk.
* Using finer adjustments, move the scope until this spot is perfectly
  centered in the white circle of the rear finder disk.
* Look into the 25mm eyepiece and look for the sun.  You may need to move
  your head around to look off to the sides.
* Repeat as neccesary.

## Good Alignment

Basically just follow the steps above.  Refinements that can be added include:

* If using telescope control software (such as Stellarium):
  - Be sure to use correct data for site location, time, etc.).  
  - Each time you re-center on the Sun, use that point to update the alignment.
* The tracking will improve more if the aligned can be updated on Sun positions
  that are widely separated; i.e., at substantially different times.
* Note that some mounts have a __park__ feature.  The scope slews to its
  home position and stores its alignment data in non-volatile memory. Thus,
  several updates can be made to the alignment without leaving the scope on
  for extended periods.  But be _very_ sure not to move the scope _at all_
  between observations.
* If using a camera, some form of tracking is essential.  SharpCap Pro
  includes a good tracking feature.
