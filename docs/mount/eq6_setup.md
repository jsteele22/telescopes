# Setting up the Skywatcher ERQ6-R Pro Mount.

* Set up the tripod.
  - Extend the legs about 10" or so and tighten to medium-snug.
  - Note the \"Black Chunk\" on top of the tripod. This is the __alignment
    post__.
  - Orient the tripod so that the alignment post is pointing North.

* Prepare to install the mount
  - There is a vertical chrome bar beneath the tripod deck. The top end is
    threaded and should be free to rise up above the tripod deck; if not, screw
    the rod in until it becomes loose.
  - Lift the mount just few inches, rotate it slightly and rest it on the
    packing foam of the case.
  - If the mount is loose and floppy, reach under the central part of the mount
    and tighten the R.A. clutch lever. 
  - Look at the bottom mating surface of the mount and identify the
    __alignment hole__.

* Install the mount.
  - Lift the mount using the handle.
  - __Orient the alignment hole with the alignment post__.
  - Place the mount gently on the tripod.
  - Use the upper knob on the vertical chrome bar to screw it medium tight
    into the mount. This will secure the mount to the tripod.

* Install the spider.
  - Remove the lower knob __and washer__ from the vertical chrome bar.
  - Install the spider, flat side up, onto the chrome bar.
  - Screw the lower knob __and washer__ about 1/2\" onto the chrome bar.
  - Adjust the spider so the 3 jaws engage the three legs.  You may find that
    the tripod legs need to be pushed outwards a bit more.
  - Turn the lower knob until it just starts to feel snug. Then lift the
    tripod legs one at a time and wiggle them a bit to ensure they are fully
    spread.
  - Now tighten the lower knob until it is medium tight.

* Install azimuth adjuster bolts.
  -- Locate the 2 adjuster bolts, and screw them slightly into the
     appropriate holes, adjacent to the tripod's alignment post.
  -- Screw in the two bolts by equal amounts until you feel resistance in
     _both_ bolts.  The bolts should be snug, not tight.

* Level the mount.
  -- Note the bubble level on the West side of the mount.
  -- Adjust the length of the tripod legs one at a time until the bubble is
     centered.
  -- Now tighten the tripod leg knobs to medium tight.

* Rough Alt. alignment.
  -- The mount has a pair of Alt (altitude) adjustment knobs right next to
     an Alt indicator dial.  Using the known lattitude of your observing site,
     adjust these knobs (loosen one, snug the other) until the Alt dial
     indicates your lattitude.

* Add counter weights.
  - The __counterweight bar__ is a chrome bar that is stowed inside the mount.
    Loosen the small black knob on the north side of the mount and loosen it
    to extend the counterweight bar.  Gently snug the knob.
  - Identify the knurled __toe saver__ nut on the end of the counterweight bar.
    Remove it, but don't set it down.
  - Add the counterweights and tighten them to the bar, near the bottom end.
    For a very small scope (e.g., the Lunt solar scope) you may only need one
    weight.
  - Replace the toe saver nut.

* Prepare mount for receiving OTA.
  - Each axis of the mount (RA and DEC) has a black clutch lever.  To adjust
    an axis, loosen the corresponding clutch, move the mount, and re-tighten.
  - The RA axis should already be oriented corectly.  If not, adjust it so
    the weight bar is pointing downward as much as possible.
  - Adjust the DEC axis so that the mount __saddle__ (the topmost part that
    holds the scope) is horizontal with the two black knobs pointing down.
  - Ensure that both clutches are snug so the mount does not move.

* Hand control and Power.
  - Ensure that the power switch on the mount is turned off.
  - Insert and screw in the power cable and connect it to a 12V DC source.
    At present, this means a battery pack with a cigarette lighter socket.
  - Plug in the hand controller into the __Hand Control__ socket.
