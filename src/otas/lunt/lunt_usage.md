# Using the Lunt Solar Telescope.

## Prerequisites

  * OTA installed on mount
  * OTA setup complete.
  * OTA balanced.

## Alignment

For casual solar observing, precise alignment is not neccesary, but
the sun will drift out of view more quickly. When using the scope for
a group, it is best to put more effort into aligning the scope precisely.


### Basic Alignment

Basic alignment consists of mechanically adjusting the mount so that
the scope will track the sun.

* Align the mount __azimuth__ using a best guess of true north; e.g., parallel
  to walls of Barnes hall. 

* Align the mount __altitude__ using your known lattitude and the scale on
  the mount; e.g., adjust dial to 38.8 degrees for Colorado Springs.

* Power on the mount and enable solar tracking.

* Point the scope towards the sun either using the hand controller or by
  using the clutches and moving the scope manually.
  
* When you get close, look *at* (not into) the solar finder.  The
  sun will cast a shadow of the front disk onto the rear disk;
  i.e., the hole will create a bright spot of light on the rear
  disk. If the bright spot is not visible, use you hand or a piece of
  paper to find it.


* Using finer adjustments, move the scope until this spot is perfectly
  centered in the white circle of the rear finder disk.

* Look into the 25mm eyepiece and look for the sun.  You may need to move
  your head around to look off to the sides.

* Using the mount controls, fine-tune the pointing until the sun is centered.


### Improving Alignment

Alignment can be improved by adjusting the mount more carefully. But
another big help is using software-based alignment to model and
correct for mechanical imperfections.

The hand controller of the white (EQ6-R Pro) mount can do this, or you
can connect a Windows/Linux computer to the mount and run software
such as Stellarium.

Note that for solar observing, there are only two alignment targets
that you can use: the scope's __home position__ (always used by
default) and the sun.


* Precisely align the mount __azimuth__ using a compass (smartphone
  app).

* Precisely align the mount __altitude__ using an inclinometer
  (smartphone app.)

* Be sure the scope is very precisely in __home position__ when
  powering the mount on.

* Be sure to use correct data for observing site location, time, etc.  

* When you have the sun centered, use that point to update the alignment.

* Each time you re-center the scope on the Sun, use that point to
  update the software alignment.

* The tracking will improve more if the alignment points are widely
  separated.  For solar observing, that means using the sun at widely
  separated times. So set up the scope and start the alignment well in
  advance.

* Note that mounts have a __park__ feature.  When told to park, the
  scope slews to its home position and stores its software alignment
  data over a power cycle.  Thus, a preliminary alignment can be done
  well in advance, and the scope parked and powered off.  When powered
  on again the mount is already aligned, and one update on the sun's
  current position should provide a good improvement.
 

## Pressure tuning the H-alpha line.

The central wavelength of the solar scope's filter can be tuned very
slightly above or below the Hydrogen alpha wavelength by turning the
large brass knob on the side of the scope.  (The brass knob is just a
threaded piston, which changes the pressure inside of the etalon.)

The filter passes light in a very narrow range ( +/- 0.035 nm) above
or below this central wavelength.  This range is much smaller than the
Doppler shift of sunlight caused by motions of the Sun's surface.
Thus, using the brass knob, you can emphasize various parts of the
Sun's surface, depending on their motion towards/away from the Earth.

WARNING: If you unscrew the knob too far, it will come off.  Always
__hold onto it securely__ when loosening.

Here is a simple method for tuning the filter:

* Loosen the brass knob about 2 or 3 turns from where it was when you
  found it. Here we are assuming the previous user left the scope
  tuned to an interesting wavelength.

* Obtain a sharp visual focus of the part of the sun you are
  interested in; e.g., a prominence on the sun's limb, or the
  oatmeal-like texture of a central part of the solar disc.

* Gradually tighten the knob, watching for a change in contrast in the
  region of interest.  It shouldn't take too many turns to see a change.

Fun Fact: When using the solar scope with a camera, it is possible to
see brightening/darkening of opposite edges of the Sun due Doppler
shifts caused by the Sun's rotation.
