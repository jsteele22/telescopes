# Telescope Mounts

The following mounts are available.  Each includes a tripod for field
use and a pier adapter for use on our observatory deck.

* [Skywatcher EQ6-R Pro](eq6/index.md) The newest mount, and best
  choice for general purpose use.  This mount has a USB port and can
  be controlled by a Windows computer or the hand controller.

* [Losmandy G11](losmandy/index.md) The strongest of our mounts and
  very well made.  This mount has a custom stepper motor system and an
  open-source (**OnStep**) controller.

* [Celestron EQ5](eq5/index.md) (aka EQ5) An older, lighter-weight
  mount. This mount has a custom stepper motor system and an
  open-source (**OnStep**) controller.
  
## Using OnStep

Two of the above mounts have **OnStep** control systems.  Since the
systems are very similar, they will be [explained together
here](using_onstep/index.md).
