# Using Stellarium with an OnStep Telescope.

Stellarium is a popular planetarium program; i.e., it creates nice
displays of stars, etc., on your computer screen.

It also has an option to control telescopes.  Our goal here is to get
Stellarium to control one of our OnStep telescopes


## Prerequisites

First of all, you need to install Stellarium on your computer and
practice using it.  Get comfortable with navigating around the sky,
zooming in and out, etc.

## Enable the Plugin

By default, the **Telescope Control Plugin** in Stellarium is not
enabled.  So the following steps are necesary:

* Start Stellarium.

* Look for the "Wrench and Star" icon ("Configuration window") and
  click on it.

* At the top right of the Configuration window, click on the "Plugins"
  tab.

* At the left of that, scroll all the way down and click on
  "Telescope Control".

* Check "Load at startup".

* Close the Configuration window.

* Don't bother clicking  on "Configure"; we're not quite ready.


## Option for Windows Users: ASCSOM
