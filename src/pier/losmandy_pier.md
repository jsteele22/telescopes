# Pier Mount for Losmandy G11 Mount.

This is a great combination: our sturdiest mount on our sturdiest support.

## Required :

These should all be stored together in the glass case by the double
doors of the Observatory:

* The Losmandy pier adapter (black anodized aluminum.)
* Threee hex screws **kept with the pier adapter at all times.**
* T-handle hex driver **kept with the pier adapter at all times.**


## Setup:

* Line the adapter up with the appropriate threaded holes in the
  pier. The little tabs for mounting the control electronics should
  point to the South.

* Get all 3 screws started.

* Screw all 3 screws to just barely touching the bottom.

* Tighten all 3 screws a **little bit snug.**

* Return the T-handle hex driver to its storage place.


The adapter is identical to the top of the Losmandy tripod, so
remainder of setup proceeds as usual.

## Takedown

* Remove the three screws.

* Return the adapter, the three screws, and the T-handle nut driver to
  their storage place.
