# CC Astronomy Documentation

A braindump of things to know about Colorado College astronomical
equipment and facilities.

## Structure 

This information resides in a [git
repository](https://github.com/jsteele22/telescopes). Authorized users
can make simple changes using the *Edit on GitHub* link. More substantial
changes should be made using conventional git tools.

The repository content is structured so that much of it can be
converted into HTML using [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org).  But for
complete access, use *git*.
