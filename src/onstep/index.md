# OnStep

**Onstep** is an open source hardware/software project to provide
smart telescope features (e.g., alignment, GoTo) to an otherwise
un-smart or even unmotorized telescope.

For general information about OnStep, go to [the OnStep project
homepage](http://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki/3860).

Two of our telescope mounts have been converted for use with
OnStep. Information regarding these particular OnStep conversions is
provided here:

* Details that are [common to both mounts](shared/index.md) 

* Details specific to the [Losmandy G11](g11/index.md) mount

* Details specific to the [Celestron EQ5](eq5/index.md) mount.
