# Losmandy G11 OnStep Conversion

## Background

Our Losmandy G11 mount came with feeble DC gearmotors that were
intended only for for.  The mount could neither slew nor perform
GoTo moves.  There was no means of keeping track of celestial
coordinates.

The addition of powerful stepper motors made it possible to control
the mount using OnStep.
