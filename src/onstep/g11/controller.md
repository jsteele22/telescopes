# MaxPCB4 Controller, Losmandy G11 details

The Losmandy mount uses the MaxPCB4 controller board.  This board is
configured as follows

* Teensy 4.1 microcontroller.

* TMC 2130 V3.0 motor driver modules (Amazon) for RA and Dec. These
  axes have RJ45 (e.g. Ethernet) socket outputs.  Conection to the
  corresponding stepper motors is via standard RJ$% patch cables.

* Two addional axes (focuser, etc.) not currently implemented.
