# CAD Files for G11 OnStep Conversion

## Stepper Motor Adapters

The stepper motor adapters were designed in OpenSCAD. Here is [the
OpenSCAD source code](losmandy1.scad) and here are the [STL
files](mount_stl/index.md).

## Controller Board Enclosure

The MaxPCB4 controller is enclosed in a housing which attaches to the
G11 mount in the same way as the original controller.

It was designed using [OnShape](http://www.onshape.com), a free web-based CAD
program.  Here are the [STL files](enclosure_stl/index.md) for the enclosure.
